          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>VNPay is a leading fintech company in providing all kinds of digital payment solutions. Before the pandemic, their main product, VNPAY-QR, was positioned for office workers and businesses. The brand positioned itself heavily with a traditional and old-fashioned image that did not appeal to a wider audience.</p>
          <p>However, the pandemic brought a significant shift in consumer behavior, with a surge in demand for contactless payment options across all demographics. To adapt to this change, VNPAY-QR recognized the need to reinvent its brand image to appear more modern, relatable, and tech-savvy.</p>

            <h2>External influence</h2>
            <p>The Covid-19 pandemic started to attract global attention in early 2020. Due to the contagious nature of the virus, which spreads mainly through direct contact with an infected person, governments around the world took several measures to reduce human-to-human contact. These included the closure of public places and public transportation, enforcement of social distancing, and public notices to maintain social distancing, stay indoors, and work from home.</p>
            <p>This therefore means that people have gradually moved to digital solutions for all their needs. Technology and the Internet have made life easier by facilitating online learning, working, and shopping. The most prominent examples of this shift are seen in huge increases in digital payment systems.</p>
            <p>Such apprehensions led public health bodies like the World Health Organization and various national governments to advise against cash transactions and the use of digital payments instead. The need for social distancing and mobility restrictions accelerated this shift toward digital platforms, where consumers could shop, make payments, and access services while minimizing physical contact.</p>
            <p>The demand has been increasing, and as a result, service providers have changed their provision to meet these changing needs. This transition into digital methods of paying for a service is very multi-dimensional in nature, catering to the requirements of different consumers. The fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has created an economic impact which is unprecedented in magnitude, with many industries being hit globally. However, the rapid growth of electronic payment systems in the banking industry has shown a bright side and helped make the financial ecosystem more robust and modernized.</p>
            <p>Besides, demographic factors did not affect the change in spending behavior through electronic payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Maybe the explanation is that the strict social distancing in Vietnam during the pandemic, and which required all people, irrespective of age, occupation, and gender, to stay confined within their homes, thus their personal necessities and spending would become more unified among different demographics.</p>
              <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375639962_An_Empirical_Insight_into_Adoption_Spending_with_Digital_Payment_System_in_Vietnam_During_Covid_19_Era" target="_blank">[Source]</a>
            <h2>Challenges and opportunities</h2>
            <h3>Narrow target audience pre-pandemic</h3>
            <h4>Challenge:</h4>
            <p>Previously, before 2020, VNPAY-QR had targeted mainly office workers and business people, excluding other groups such as students, families, and the elderly. The narrow targeting, along with unappealing promotion strategies, has restricted the number of users for the platform. However, the rapid increase in digital payment adoption during the Covid-19 pandemic underlined the need for more inclusive strategies that could meet the diverse needs of consumers across all age groups and professions. As the cashless transition in Vietnam accelerated, VNPAY-QR was faced with the challenge of expanding its reach to engage a wider audience and stay competitive in the rapidly growing digital payment market.</p>
            <span><br></span>
            <h4>Digital payment usage growth:</h4>
              <p>This trend is especially phenomenal in Vietnam, with a 170% surge in the volume of online payment transactions in 2020, according to the State Bank of Vietnam, and up to 40% more users making QR code payments. This reflects a broader regional movement in Southeast Asia, where many consumers have increasingly adopted cashless transactions. In fact, 84% of consumers in the region reported a shift toward cashless living, making Southeast Asia lead the transition into digital payments. On average, consumers in Southeast Asia can maintain a cashless lifestyle for 10.3 days-a figure matched by Malaysia and second in the region only to the Philippines at 12 days.</p>
              <p>It is in this transformation that, particularly, Vietnam is setting the pace: rapid development, uptake of digital payment platforms through mobile banking applications, QR code, and e-wallets. Its government's thrust on financial inclusions and an increasing fintech innovation have accelerated the move toward digital payment modes, especially in both rural and urban populations. In particular, Vietnam's leading position acts as a driving force toward a cashless economy in the region; it will consequently lay the bedrock for the same increased digitization and deeper integration across Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p></p>
            <span><br></span>
          <h3>Outdated branding strategy</h3>
          <h4>Challenge:</h4>
          <p>The outdated branding of the company and traditional promotional materials could not impress the potential young, more tech-savvy audience that was more likely to adopt digital payment solutions. Instead of using modern, dynamic marketing methods that would resonate with today's digital-first consumers, VNPAY-QR was doing conventional advertising, which was uncreative and failed to highlight the convenience and security of their services. This created a disconnect with potential users, particularly those unfamiliar with fintech solutions, who may view the platform as less appealing or less trustworthy than other, more agile competitors. In that respect, the company lost an opportunity to reach some key demographics such as students and young professionals-early adopters of digital technologies who play an important role in driving the cashless economy.</p>
        <span><br></span>
          <h4>Social media engagement:</h4>
        <p>In 2020, Vietnam recorded an estimated 73.56 million social network users, about 75.6% of the country's total population. Of these users, about 23 million were between 18 and 34 years of age, nearly equally divided in terms of gender. Social media was dominated by Facebook, where users predominantly engaged with video and photo content, using tools such as Facebook Messenger for communication and buying goods online. It describes the high degree of social media use among Vietnamese customers, further down the road toward an economy with complete or minimal use of cash transactions and digital means of payment. Companies utilizing those platforms for marketing purposes, therefore, would achieve much better access to such a tech-savvy audience: for example, this could have significantly accelerated user acquisition for VNPAY-QR in the cashless economic transition.</p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>Every individual is unique, and so are brands. Making a brand more humanistic can make it stand out in the competitive marketplace. One of the methods through which this is done is by developing a brand mascot, thereby giving the brand an identity with which people can relate. A well-designed mascot makes a brand memorable to differentiate it from other businesses selling similar products.</p>
        <p>Brands like VNPAY-QR can use mascots to increase audience engagement by giving a "face" to the brand. People naturally would feel more at ease interacting with a relatable persona rather than a faceless entity. Similar to how personal connections are stronger when there is a recognizable individual involved, consumers are more likely to participate in brand activities and conversations when a mascot is present.</p>
        <a href="https://www.sketchy.digital/blog/brand-mascot-character-development" target="_blank">[Source]</a>
        <p></p>
        <span><br></span>
        <h3>Defining the character</h3>
        <p>Operating in this fast-growing digital payment market, VNPAY-QR has to develop a mascot that will be one of a kind and not only visually appealing but also memorable. It should not be just a technical figure representing the platform; it needs to reflect humanistic traits: humor, wisdom, friendliness. By integrating these facets, the character will be of great help in bridging the gap in advanced technology in the platform and making it close enough and relatable to ordinary people for wide usage in digitized payments.</p>
        <span><br></span>
        <h3>Inspirations and concept</h3>
        <div class="image-single">
          <img src="images/VNPAYQR-moodboard.png" class="moodboard">
          </div>
          <text>Mood inspiration board [Image sources: Behance, Pinterest]</text>
        <p>The character was conceived as an otherworldly figure: larger than life, yet intrinsically friendly. This combination of heroism and friendliness positioned him as a guiding symbol for users, offering support and encouragement in navigating the complexities of digital payments during uncertain times. Whereas gods are generally held to be unreachable and incomprehensible, Thanh Ma was to be as personable and accessible as possible, thereby bridging the gap between technology and the end-user from every walk of life.</p>
        <p>Relatability was a core design principle, ensuring the character resonated with diverse audiences:</p>
        <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Young adults: The character is cool and tech-savvy; he just fit into the exact mold that digital lifestyle and comfort with online platforms have gotten them accustomed to.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Older generations:  The character should also come across as friendly, non-threatening, approachable, and reassuring for the unfamiliar technological intervention known as cashless payments.</p>
        <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Rural communities: By positioning the character as relatable and helpful, VNPAY-QR will be able to present cashless payment solutions as simple and practical tools to solve everyday problems even in areas that are not well exposed to fintech.</p>
          <span><br></span>
        <p>Beyond being just an icon for the brand, the character was created to be a character of storytelling, giving a face to digital payment technology. He could engage users through promotions, step-by-step instructions, and explaining the process in an understandable manner. A human touch for a digital service-the character built trust and engagement, making VNPAY-QR friendlier and closer to more people.</p>
        <div class="image-single">
          <img src="images/VNPAYQR-moodboard2.png" class="moodboard">
          </div>
          <text>Face and outfit inspiration board [Image sources: Google Image, Pinterest]</text>
        <p>The character’s face and outfit were inspired by the appearance of an average, friendly, and casually dressed Vietnamese man, making him relatable to a broad audience across different regions of Vietnam.
          His design reflects some common characteristics usually associated with the ordinary Vietnamese person: easygoing, industrious, and communal. The outfit is simple and practical, resembling what locals might wear in daily life, reinforcing his accessibility and down-to-earth persona.</p>
        <span><br></span>
          <p>To balance this relatability with the character's symbolic heroism, subtle elements were added to remind users of his superhuman qualities. A coat was added to give him a dynamic, heroic silhouette; a sleek mask and a pair of gloves lent a futuristic touch and hinted at his tech-savviness and problem-solving abilities.
          These elements are subtle but help drive home the point that Thanh Ma is not a regular character but one who has the wisdom and strength to lead users through the maze of digital payments. This blend of familiarity and heroism helps position the character as both a trustworthy guide and an aspirational figure in VNPAY-QR's brand narrative.</p>
          <h2>Result</h2>
    <h3>Vision and symbolism:</h3>
    <p>Thanh Ma, or "The God of Code," was envisioned as a heroic figure personifying the power of modern technology in simplifying life. As much as he embodies the strength, wisdom, and commanding presence associated with gods, he is approachable and friendly. Thanh Ma acts as a crucial bridge between the maze of fintech solutions and the user's practical needs, demystifying digital payments and building trust through a more relatable, humanized story.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Core characteristics:</h3>
    <p>Hero yet humble: Thanh Ma is confident but approachable to both the tech-savvy youth and the more cautious older generation.</p>
    <p>Tech-oriented: The name denotes his relationship to coding and innovation, highlighting the advanced capabilities of VNPAY-QR.</p>
    <p>Inclusive: Designed to appeal to both urban and rural users, Thanh Ma embodies the values of accessibility, education, and unity.</p>
    <div class="image-single">

      </div>
      <text>Character design</text>
      <h3>Thanh Ma and social media platforms</h3>
    <p>Thanh Ma opens a wide door to VNPAY-QR for creating various types of content: entertaining, educational, and even instructive. The character can be used in various digital channels for humorous, educational, or motivational messages that increase user interaction and brand loyalty.</p>
     <p>By featuring Thanh Ma prominently in social media posts, VNPAY-QR can make its communications more relatable and interactive. The mascot can present promotional offers, share practical tips on using digital payment services, and even respond to customer queries in a lighthearted yet professional manner. This approach humanizes the brand and fosters a more engaging, personalized relationship with users, helping to demystify fintech solutions and make digital payments more accessible to a broader audience.</p>

      <p>Coffee Packaging Design | Client: Lacàph | Date: 2023</p>
      <p>Researched, Illustrated, and Designed by Lana Hoang | Photographed by Kevin Lung | Coffee's Guided and Interviewed by Nguyen Nguyen</p>

      <a href="https://www.lacaph.com/en/" target="_blank">[Lacàph's Website]</a>
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>The flavors of Lacàph's coffee and vivid stories of their cultural background remained underrepresented in the previous packaging designs. The illustrations on the former package did not provide depth and linkage to the characteristics of each flavor profile; hence, missing out on curiosity and connection.</p>
      <p>Lacàph aims to make coffee culture a shared experience, uniting people, creating meaningful connections, and sparking joy in every cup. The previous design did not fully reflect this vision or resonate with the diverse audience they want to engage. The packaging fell short of delivering a visual experience that invites exploration and celebrates the cultural richness behind Lacàph's offerings.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <h3>In-store interview feedback: packaging and design perception</h3>
      <p>At the shop, there is a bar where customers can enjoy the coffee while also purchasing the coffee beans. As part of the project, I enlisted the help of one of the baristas to gather feedback from customers through short interviews. The group consisted of regular buyers as well as customers who were there simply to enjoy the coffee but had never purchased the product before.</p>

        <text>Nguyen's coffee tasting service and interview</text>
      <h4>Question: "What are your thoughts on our product's design?"</h4>
      <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Regular customer 1: "I think the coffee is great, but the packaging doesn’t stand out much."</p>
      <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Regular customer 2: "I enjoy the taste, but I’m not sure if the design really reflects the quality of the coffee inside. It looks basic."</p>
      <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Potential customer 1: "I’ve noticed it on the shelf before, but honestly, it didn’t catch my eye. The packaging doesn't make it look like a coffee product."</p>
      <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Potential customer 2: 
     "I am not sure what to expect from the coffee just by looking at the packaging. It’s just not eye-catching enough to make me want to pick it up over other brands."</p>
     <span><br></span>
     <h4>Question: "What do you like and dislike about the packaging?"</h4> 
      <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Regular customer 1:
        "I like that it looks simple, but it could be more visually appealing. The illustrations don't help me differentiate between the flavors, and they don’t feel tied to the coffee’s identity."</p>
      <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Regular customer 2:
        "It doesn’t feel like it reflects the vibrancy of the coffee culture. I dislike that there’s nothing on the packaging to tell me about the cultural significance."</p>
      <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Potential customer 1:
        "I like the clean look, but it feels a bit generic. I would have appreciated something that tells me more about what makes the coffee special. I saw the bag in a supermarket before, but I got it confused for other tea products next to it. "</p>
      <p style="margin-left:3rem;">Potential customer 2:
        "I had trouble identifying the flavor from the images alone. I like the idea of having the coffee beans available in-store, but the packaging needs to be more engaging."</p>  
      <span><br></span>
        <h3>Key takeaways from the interviews</h3>
        <h4>Lack of visual appeal:</h4>
        <p>Customer feedback highlighted that the coffee packaging failed to capture attention or spark curiosity on the shelves. In a competitive market, where visual differentiation is crucial, the design did not stand out enough to leave a lasting impression.</p>

    <p>Understanding Nystagmus and the Role of 3D Model Design in Overcoming Challenges | Client: Personal Project | Date: 2024—</p>
    <p>Researched and 3D Designed by Lana Hoang</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <p>*As I continue to deepen my understanding of the topic and refine my skills with the tools, this project remains a work in progress.*</p>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <h3>Understanding nystagmus</h3>
    <p>Nystagmus is a visual impairment characterized by involuntary, repetitive eye movements that can affect a person’s ability to focus on objects, perceive depth, and maintain spatial awareness. These challenges can lead to difficulties in daily tasks such as reading, navigating unfamiliar environments, and maintaining balance. For individuals with nystagmus, the world can feel unstable and disorienting, impacting their confidence and independence.</p>
    <p>One of the lesser discussed struggles faced by individuals with nystagmus is the impact on proprioception, the body’s ability to sense its position and movement in space. Proprioception relies heavily on visual input to maintain balance and spatial orientation. However, for individuals with nystagmus, the brain receives distorted or incomplete visual information, making it harder to gauge distances, avoid obstacles, or perform tasks that require hand-eye coordination.</p>
    <a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/your-eyes/eye-conditions-az/nystagmus/" target="_blank">[Source]</a>
    <p></p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Why focus on nystagmus?</h3>
    <p>Unlike more widely recognized visual impairments, nystagmus poses a distinct set of challenges that require specialized solutions. Individuals with nystagmus often struggle with tasks that rely on steady visual input, such as reading, driving, or navigating unfamiliar spaces. Despite these significant hurdles, there remains a lack of tailored assistive tools and technologies specifically designed to support this community.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the prevalence of nystagmus is higher than many realize. According to the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), approximately 24 in every 10,000 people live with some form of nystagmus. Yet public awareness of this condition remains low, contributing to gaps in support services and technological advancements.</p>
    <p>Addressing nystagmus through innovative design not only promotes inclusivity but also sets a precedent for how emerging technologies can cater to niche disabilities. It highlights the importance of thinking beyond generalized solutions and creating tools that cater to specific, nuanced needs in the broader context of accessibility and human-centered design.</p>
    <a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/your-eyes/eye-conditions-az/nystagmus/" target="_blank">[Source]</a>
    <p></p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Role of 3D model design</h3>
    <p>3D models, especially those tailored for accessibility, provide opportunities to enhance depth perception, improve spatial awareness, and offer interactive, engaging experiences that adapt to individual needs.</p>
    <p>By addressing the unique challenges of nystagmus through 3D model design, this approach not only fosters greater inclusivity but also opens new possibilities for learning and independence. As technology continues to evolve, digital 3D models will remain a powerful tool in breaking down barriers and improving the quality of life for individuals living with visual impairments.</p>
    <h2>Understanding nystagmus</h2>
    <p>Nystagmus is generally classified into two major types:</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Infantile (congenital) nystagmus</h3>
    <p>This type appears early in life, typically within the first few months after birth. It is often associated with underlying genetic or developmental issues and tends to remain stable throughout life.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h4>Characteristics:</h4>
    <p>Onset: Within the first 6 months of life.</p>
    <p>Rhythm: Regular, rhythmic, involuntary eye movements (horizontal is most common, but can also be vertical or rotary).</p>
    <p>Oscillations: Often jerk (fast and slow phases) or pendular (even back-and-forth) movements.</p> 
    <p>Null point: A head position where eye movement is minimized, leading to a better vision posture (e.g., tilting the head to one side).</p>
    <p>Vision impact: Reduced visual acuity and difficulty focusing.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h4>The role of the brain’s visual processing systems and ocular motor systems in causing nystagmus</h4>
    <p>The visual processing system:</p>
    <p>The brain’s visual processing system consists of the structures and pathways that interpret visual information from the eyes and translate it into what we perceive as vision. In people with nystagmus, abnormalities in this system disrupt the stability and clarity of the visual input.</p>
    <p>Key areas involved in visual processing include:</p>
    <p>Retina: The first point of contact for visual information. It converts light into electrical signals.</p>
    <p>Optic nerve: Transmits visual signals from the retina to the brain.</p>
    <p>Primary visual cortex (V1): The first brain region that processes visual information.</p>
    <p>Oculomotor control centers: Areas of the brain responsible for controlling eye movements, including:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Brainstem: Contains key nuclei (e.g., the oculomotor nucleus) that regulate eye muscles.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Cerebellum: Helps fine-tune eye movements to ensure they are smooth and coordinated.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Frontal eye fields: Involved in voluntary eye movements.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h4>How do abnormalities cause nystagmus?</h4>
    <p>Infantile nystagmus occurs when feedback loops between the brain and eyes malfunction, leading to uncontrolled oscillations of the eyes.</p>
    <p>There are two main feedback loops involved in normal eye control:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">The fixation loop – Keeps the eyes stable on a target.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">The gaze-holding loop – Ensures that the eyes stay aligned when looking in different directions.</p>
    <p>In people with nystagmus, one or both loops are disrupted due to abnormalities in the brain’s control centers or how the eyes send feedback to the brain. As a result:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">The brain misinterprets visual feedback, causing the eyes to drift away from the target.</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">The brain then overcorrects, leading to the characteristic rhythmic oscillations of nystagmus.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h4>Key brain structures implicated:</h4>
    <p>Medial vestibular nucleus: Coordinates head and eye movements.</p>
    <p>Nucleus of the optic tract: Helps stabilize gaze during movement.</p>
    <p>Interpositus nucleus in the cerebellum: Modulates eye movement precision.</p>
    <p>The brain structures responsible for maintaining stable gaze are often hyperactive or misregulated in infantile nystagmus.</p>
    <p>Treatments focus on modulating these feedback loops to reduce oscillations.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h4>Insights from neuroimaging and genetic studies to identify specific abnormalities</h4>
    <p>Recent genetic studies have identified specific mutations linked to infantile nystagmus. These genes affect ocular motor development and retinal function.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <p>Key genes identified:</p>
    <p>FRMD7</p>
    <p>The most common gene associated with infantile nystagmus.</p>
    <p>Mutations in FRMD7 affect the development of neurons in the brainstem responsible for eye movement control.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, FRMD7 mutations are linked to X-linked inheritance, meaning it primarily affects males but can be passed down by mothers.</p>
    <p>GPR143</p>
    <p>Linked to ocular albinism, which often coexists with nystagmus.</p>
    <p>The mutation disrupts melanin production in the retina, affecting the development of visual pathways.</p>
    <p>CACNA1A and SLC38A8</p>
    <p>Associated with abnormal calcium channels in neurons.</p>
    <p>These mutations affect signal transmission in the brain and contribute to nystagmus.</p>

    <p></p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Acquired nystagmus</h3>
    <p>This type develops later in life due to underlying medical conditions or neurological damage. It is typically more problematic because patients experience oscillopsia (a sensation that the world is moving).</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h4>Characteristics:</h4>
    <p>Onset: Can occur at any age after infancy, depending on the cause.</p>
    <p>Rhythm: Can be jerk, pendular, or mixed.</p>
    <p>Oscillopsia: Common symptom – Patients feel as though their environment is moving, which can cause dizziness and disorientation.</p>
    <p>Associated symptoms: May include dizziness, vertigo, and balance issues.</p>
    <p>It is often progressive and can get worse over time.</p>
    <p>It can improve with treatment of the underlying cause.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h4>Common causes</h4>
    <p>Neurological disorders:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;"> Multiple sclerosis (MS)</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;"> Stroke</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;"> Brainstem lesions</p>
    <p>Inner ear disorders:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Vestibular dysfunction</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;">Meniere’s disease</p>
    <p>Medication side effects:</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 3em;"> Antiepileptics, sedatives, or alcohol</p>
    <p>Head trauma or brain injury.</p>

    <h3>Potential impact of nystagmus on mental health and social interaction</h3>
  <p>People with nystagmus, a condition characterized by involuntary eye movements, often face challenges beyond vision impairment. These challenges can affect self-esteem, mental health, and social interactions, leading to emotional distress and social isolation.</p>
  <span><br></span>
  <h4>Emotional and Psychological Impact</h4>
  <p>Self-consciousness about eye movements:</p>
  <p>The visible nature of nystagmus can make individuals feel self-conscious or embarrassed, especially in social settings where eye contact is expected.</p>
  <p>Difficulty maintaining eye contact:</p>
  <p>Eye contact plays a critical role in non-verbal communication. Avoiding eye contact can affect their social confidence.</p>
  <p>Reduced independence:</p>
  <p>Nystagmus can impact reading, navigation, and participation in daily tasks, leading to feelings of helplessness or frustration.</p>
  <h4>Social interaction challenges</h4>
  <p>The involuntary eye movements caused by nystagmus can be misinterpreted by others. For example:</p>
    <p>Lack of eye contact might be seen as disinterest or dishonesty.</p>
    <p>Shifting gaze could be perceived as nervousness or lack of confidence.</p>
    <p>This can result in social exclusion and awkward interactions, especially in job interviews, dating, and public speaking situations.</p>

  <h2>How 3D model design helps in accessibility</h2>
    <h3>Improved spatial understanding and navigation</h3>
    <p>One significant challenge for users with nystagmus is depth perception, which is achieved by understanding the relative positioning of objects in space. 3D models can aid in navigating environments by providing a realistic layout that mimics the real world. 3D models can incorporate texture mapping, shading, and lighting to clearly define spatial relationships, which is essential for users who struggle with accurate visual placement or orientation.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Supporting spatial memory and recognition</h3>
    <p>3D models enhance spatial memory, a crucial skill for recognizing and navigating environments. In space recognition learning, they can provide structured, consistent representations of objects, enabling users with visual impairments to identify landmarks and navigate using spatial cues more effectively.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Potential applications of 3D Models for visual impairments and nystagmus</h3>
    <h4>Virtual navigation and mapping</h4>
    <p>3D models can be used to design interactive maps for urban or architectural navigation, providing users with a clear understanding of spatial layouts and context.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 3rem;">Real-time VR navigation:A 3D map can simulate a virtual cityscape, allowing users to explore environments at their own pace. The model can adapt to the user’s focus, featuring larger fonts for instructions, high-contrast paths, and distinct visual markers to highlight obstacles and key landmarks.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 3rem;">Accessible environment simulation: 3D models enable users with visual impairments to "experience" spaces through virtual exploration, helping them build familiarity and confidence in navigating real-world environments.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Educational tools for space recognition</h3>
    <p>In space recognition learning, interactive 3D models allow users to practice identifying spatial relationships and interact with objects in virtual spaces, improving their spatial awareness and memory.</p>
    <p>These models help users learn to recognize objects by their shape, size, and position, reinforcing their ability to navigate environments. For instance, in geography or architecture education, users can explore cities, landmarks, or historical sites through 3D models, enhanced by auditory or haptic feedback, making the experience more immersive and accessible.</p>

    <p></p>
    <h2>Prototype idea</h2>
    <p>3D models can be designed to accommodate individuals with nystagmus by incorporating the following features:</p>
    <p>space and depth, good lighting, contrasting colours,  adjustable position, zooming option, and focus points.</p>
    <p>Accessible 3D models and environments, that accommodate individuals with visual impairments such as nystagmus, can enhance their ability to navigate, learn, and interact with spatial information effectively.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Space and depth perception</h3>
    <p>Depth perception is crucial for users to distinguish between objects in the foreground and background:</p>
    <p>Realistic shadows and dynamic lighting create a clear sense of depth.</p>
    <p>Objects overlap appropriately convey which ones are in front and which are behind.</p>

      </div>
      <text>Creating 3D model with environment background to create depth and space</text>
    <h3>Brightness adjustment</h3>
    <p>People perceive visual information differently depending on lighting conditions and contrast levels. Users with visual impairments often struggle to distinguish objects and text if the environment is too dark or too bright. Brightness adjustment allows users to customize the lighting in a virtual space to meet their specific visual needs.</p>
    <p>Brightness adjustment is an essential feature to make 3D models and virtual environments more accessible for users with visual impairments. It helps people with low contrast sensitivity, nystagmus, patchy vision, and other conditions that affect their ability to perceive objects in different lighting conditions.</p>
    <p>For individuals with nystagmus, involuntary eye movements make it harder to focus on objects in low light environments. Therefore, brightness control can improve their ability to detect objects in fragmented visual fields 
      help certain colors stand out more clearly and.</p>
    <div class="image-row">
      <img src="images/3dfoodstall-fullnight.jpg" class="twoimages">
      <img src="images/3dfoodstall-fullday.jpg" class="twoimages">
      </div>
      <text>Good lighting makes it easier to see details in the scene</text>
      <h3>Low contrast sensitivity</h3>
      <p>People with low contrast sensitivity struggle to see objects that do not stand out distinctly from their background. Lighting and color schemes in the environment become essential for these individuals.</p>
      <p>Color and contrast control: Offer options to change the background color, foreground text color, and text size. For instance, users can switch between different high-contrast schemes.</p>
      <p>Contrast slider: Enable users to increase or decrease the contrast between the foreground (text, objects) and the background.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>Adjustable viewpoints and zooming</h3>
    <p>Allow users to adjust their viewpoint or zoom to focus on specific areas of the model. This feature is particularly helpful for users with patchy vision or low contrast sensitivity.</p>
    <p>Zoom and pan controls: Provide smooth zooming and panning controls that let users focus on details or step back to see the whole model.</p>

      <p>Demand forecasting: AI-driven analytics predict customer demand patterns, allowing for more precise purchasing and preparation, thereby decreasing the likelihood of excess food.</p>
      <p>Spoilage reduction: Monitoring tools identify perishable items approaching their expiration, prompting timely utilization or discounts to prevent waste.</p>
      <p>The WRAP report underscores the economic and environmental benefits of such investments, advocating for broader adoption across the foodservice industry
        <a href="https://www.wrap.ngo/resources/report/benefits-reducing-global-food-waste" target="_blank">[Source]</a>.
      </p>
      <span><br></span>
      <h3>Social impact</h3>
      <p>According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), eliminating food waste could provide enough food to feed more than twice the global population of undernourished individuals.</p>
      <p>How the UN World Food Programme (WFP) tackles food waste and loss?</p>
      <p>Improved Food Storage
        Small-scale farmers often lose up to half of their harvest due to inadequate storage facilities. WFP provides solutions like silos and air-tight bags, reducing post-harvest losses from 40% to just 2%.</p>
      <p>Nonperishable Food Rations
        WFP distributes durable staples such as flour, dried beans, salt, and cooking oil in sturdy packaging. These long-lasting foods minimize spoilage and waste while ensuring reliable nutrition.</p>
      <p>Innovative Solutions
        Through initiatives like hydroponic farming and virtual farmers' markets, WFP supports communities in growing, storing, and selling food sustainably, even in challenging environments.</p>
      <p>Supportive Policies
        WFP works on policies like the U.S. Farm Bill, which facilitates the redistribution of surplus American crops—such as rice, corn, and wheat—to feed hungry populations, ensuring excess food reaches those in need
      <a href="https://www.wfpusa.org/articles/how-food-waste-affects-world-hunger/#:~:text=How%20Much%20Food%20Do%20We,undernourished%20people%20across%20the%20globe." target="_blank">[Source]</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <h3>What are people saying in the food industry</h3>
      <p>We conducted interviews with food industry professionals to gain insights into their goals, challenges, and frustrations within the food service sector. Through these conversations, we explored their unique perspectives on the industry's evolving needs and identified common pain points in areas such as food waste management, operational efficiency, and customer engagement.</p>
      <span><br></span>
      <p>“Tracking daily waste is feasible, but maintaining accuracy while serving customers can be difficult. The challenge lies in determining a clear "end of the day" for counting, as last-minute sales often require recalculations. Additionally, manually logging everything on paper is a time-consuming process that adds to the complexity.” — Retail Supervisor
        Taylor <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xzlxCrzFrjnV6ppEsUThQ9CXXpnXpHHH8qZXQYpba8k/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.ybgi6we7cfh" target="_blank">[Full interview]</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Many businesses, particularly small restaurants and franchises, view the costs of new technologies as “prohibitive”. Without clear proof of return on investment, owners are hesitant to invest in these systems.</p>
      <span><br></span>
      <p>“I’ve been running this restaurant for many years, and over time, I’ve developed a strong sense of the patterns in customer demand and the quantities I need to order. I know exactly what sells and how much to stock, so I rely on my experience to gauge these amounts—essentially, I "eyeball" it. My intuition and familiarity with the business make me confident in my ability to make these decisions. However, this knowledge is something I’ve built up personally over the years, and my store staff don’t have the same level of understanding or insight into the nuances of what’s needed." — Family-Run Restaurant
        Owner Kai
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xzlxCrzFrjnV6ppEsUThQ9CXXpnXpHHH8qZXQYpba8k/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mp301kvfmdk" target="_blank">[Full interview]</a>.
      </p>
      <p>New tech often feels overwhelming and hard to learn. Experienced business owners often rely on traditional methods and feel these systems are unnecessary, while frequent staff turnover adds to training challenges. A small family-run restaurant, for instance, would normally prefer relying on personal experience for food inventory management rather than using software​.</p>
      <span><br></span>
      <p>“The food industry has been slow to embrace technology, largely due to high costs and liability concerns, which pose significant challenges—particularly for smaller franchise locations with limited resources. These barriers often prevent us from investing in modern solutions that could streamline operations and reduce waste.” — Franchise Restaurant
        Founder Jay <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xzlxCrzFrjnV6ppEsUThQ9CXXpnXpHHH8qZXQYpba8k/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.xcdf5eu8h5vq" target="_blank">[Full interview]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The food industry as a whole is slower to adopt technology compared to other industries, partly because of strict government rules and the fact that food spoils quickly. Businesses need affordable, scalable, and user-friendly solutions to overcome these barriers. In particular, franchise owners face the challenge of maintaining quality and consistency across locations, which makes adopting new systems risky.</p>
      <span><br></span>
      <h3>Challenges faced by small businesses</h3>
      <p>Limited Resources: Many small businesses operate with constrained budgets, making significant investments in technology difficult.</p>
      <p>Lack of Technical Expertise: A shortage of in-house technical skills can impede the effective implementation and utilization of advanced tools.</p>
      <p>Scalability Issues: Solutions designed for large enterprises may not be suitable or cost-effective for smaller operations
        <a href="https://vorecol.com/blogs/blog-challenges-faced-by-small-businesses-in-adopting-digital-transformation-8836" target="_blank">[Source]</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Food industry and technologies</h2>

      <h2>The future of technologies in the food industry</h2>
      <p>Based on our interviews with hospitality industry experts and research on potential trends, we’ve developed targeted solutions to address the key barriers to adopting food waste management technologies. These solutions aim to make technology more accessible, cost-effective, and user-friendly, empowering businesses to reduce waste and improve efficiency.</p>
      <span><br></span>
      <h3>"They are too expensive"</h3>
      <p>Potential Solutions:</p>
      <p>Custom systems tailored to the scale of individual restaurants: Smaller establishments might benefit from lightweight, cost-effective tools focused on simple inventory tracking and waste reduction, while larger operations could implement more advanced, integrated systems leveraging AI and IoT for real-time data analysis and predictive insights
        <a href="https://www.leanpath.com/" target="_blank">[Leanpath]</a>.</p>
      <p>Savings calculator and real-time ROI(Return on Investment) tracking: An AI-powered feature in food management systems that calculates potential and actual cost savings. Restaurant can learn how much they could save by reducing over-ordering, spoilage, and waste. The feature could also provide real-time insights and suggestions into cost savings from better inventory management (eg. tracking how much less food is wasted each week).</p>
      <p>Freemium or subscription-based models: Introduce a tiered pricing system where businesses can start with basic features for free or at a low cost, and then scale up as they see value (eg. Flashfood).</p>
      <p>Cost-sharing partnerships: Create partnerships with government or sustainability organizations to offer grants or subsidies for adopting food-saving technologies.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>"They are complicated and hard to switch"</h3>
    <p>Potential Solutions:</p>
    <p>AI-Powered Training Assistants: Use AI chatbots or interactive guides within the software to help employees and owners learn the system step-by-step (eg. AI trainers for inventory management or IoT sensor setup).</p>
    <p>Plug-and-Play Devices: IoT sensors or smart scales that are easy to install and integrate into existing workflows without requirement of high technical expertise.</p>
    <p>Simplified UI (User Interface): Prioritize clean, minimal UIs in software, with features like one-click inventory updates or automated waste tracking. A mobile-first approach can also help reach users more easily, since employees are more familiar with their phones.</p>
    <span><br></span>
    <h3>"They are not common enough yet because food industry is slow"</h3>
    <p>Potential Solutions:</p>
    <p>Industry-Wide Standards and Integration: Collaborate with industry stakeholders to create a standard protocol for integrating technologies, ensuring compatibility across platforms. For example, a universal dashboard could be designed for IoT devices, or a data visualization standard could be created for food waste metrics. These standards would present data in a clear, consistent, and user-friendly way, regardless of the hardware or software being used.</p>
    <p>Community-Focused Features: Build platforms that allow small businesses to share resources or collaborate, such as shared kitchens or group purchasing of surplus food. For example, an app could facilitate food redistribution between nearby businesses.</p>
    <p>Gamification for Awareness and Adoption: Use gamification to encourage use, for example ewarding businesses with points for reducing waste, completing training modules, or hitting sustainability goals. These points could translate into discounts or perks.</p>
